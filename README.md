## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Covid-19 pandemic drastically changed the retail industry. Specifically, it catalyzed the rise of e-commerce, as the lockdown made online shopping the only option. Nearly all stores were closed temporarily, and many shut down permanently due to financial losses. 

My project will explore trends in the rise of online shopping. It is in the form of a data-driven news article you might find online. These are the main questions I will address:
- How did the pandemic affect different retail industries?
- How did online shopping habits, specifically on Amazon, change with the pandemic? 
- How did e-commerce evolve with increasing Covid-19 cases?
