## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the a series of Jupyter notebooks you create to do the data analysis.

* Update this README file to document the notebooks and give a short description of what each one does.

- Ecommerce_Covid 
 This notebook analyzes two data sets: retail_sales_data and covid_data to examine the relationship between the rise of e-commerce and the evolution of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. It first identifies the top performing and worst performing industries, recognizes online retail as a top performing industry, and then investigates the relationship between rising Covid-19 cases and e-commerce.


- Ecommerce_Amazon
This notebook investigates the rise in online retail further. It considers the financial performance of the world's largest online retailer, Amazon, during the pandemic. It looks at the most popular product categories on amazon by % of purchases in February 2020 (prior to pandemic) and April 2020 (during the pandemic).
