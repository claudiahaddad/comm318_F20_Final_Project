## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

This project looks at how Covid-19 has affected retail industries and considers how Covid-19 accelerated the boon in e-commerce. It utilizes data from the U.S Census Bureau, Statista, and Yahoo Finance. Amazon's financial performance and consumer behavior are analyzed. My findings are presented in the form of a data-driven journalism article and can be found in the notebook titled "Final_Presentation".
