Businesses closed their doors; for some, this was a temporary hiatus. For others, especially small businesses and restaurants, it was permanent. Today, 9 months later, many cities are still shut down or have restrictions.\n",

To analyze this trend, we can examine a <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/retail/index.html\"> dataset</a> from the US Census Bureau that records monthly percent changes in retail sales by industry, beginning in February 2019 .\n",

    "Similar to clothing stores, most sporting good stores were considered non-essential and had to shut down. On one hand people were exercising more and exploring the outdoors, participating in activities like tennis and hiking. In the start of the pandemic, people were exercising from home more and investing in gym equipment -- which led to a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/weights-dumbbells-not-in-stock-online-many-retailers-gyms-closed-2020-6\"> serious shortage of home gym equipment </a> that continues to this day. On the other hand, people were definitely avoiding contact sports and high school/college sports had their seasons canceled. One silver lining for this industry is that these stores are often larger than clothing stores so could probably accomodate larger capacities during the early reopening phases.\n",

    "Many small businesses invested in online platforms to facilitate ordering and pickup. These investments will probably pay off in the long term as they provide convenience to customers and help businesses work more efficiently.

These insights may be helpful when deciding which stocks to invest in, which companies to work for, and how to allocate money. Some industries will be untouched by challenges like pandemics, natural disasters, and economic turmoil. Others, such as travel and retail, feel the impact the hardest. Covid-19 brought a lot of instability and uncertainty, but with the news of a vaccine, there is light at the end of the tunnel for people and businesses. "
